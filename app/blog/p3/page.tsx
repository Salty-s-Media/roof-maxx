            When the time comes for a new roof on your home, several factors
            must be considered, including the benefits each material provides,
            what will look best, and the replacement cost. Unfortunately,
            determining which roof option is cheapest isn’t always cut and dry,
            as what appears to cost less may cost you more when considering the
            roof’s life expectancy, energy efficiency, and impact on property
            value. We provide an in-depth look at the cost of metal roofs vs.
            shingles and the factors that impact the overall cost of a new roof.

          <h3>6 Factors That Impact the Cost of Your Roof</h3>
          <p>
            Having a better idea of how much your roof will cost upfront and
            over its life will help you make a better comparison of the roof
            replacement options. Here are six factors that affect the cost of
            your roof.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Cost of Materials</strong>
              <p>
                Shingle roofs have some of the lowest upfront costs, with an
                average of $160 per 100 square feet in material costs.
                Higher-quality shingle options may increase the total bill, but
                the materials on the average asphalt roofing project cost
                between $5,000 and $10,000. That range doesn’t include
                installation costs. Metal roofs cost considerably more upfront,
                with materials costing about two to three times more than you’d
                spend on asphalt shingles. However, metal roofs typically last
                much longer, require fewer repairs, provide greater energy
                efficiency, and aid in increasing the home value.

            <li>
              <strong>Labor Costs</strong>
              <p>
                When comparing the labor costs for installing metal roofs vs.
                shingle roofs, you’ll find that they differ widely, just like
                the material costs. Installing a shingle roof will usually cost
                around $200–$300 per square foot, while metal roofing
                installation might be closer to $300–$500 per square foot. For a
                1,500-square-foot roof, the total labor cost of metal roofs vs.
                shingles may come in at around:
                <ul>
                  <li>$4,500–$7,500 for a metal roof</li>
                  <li>$3,000–$4,500 for a shingle roof</li>
                </ul>
                Unfortunately, roof size isn’t the only factor when determining
                labor expenses. Metal roofs take longer and can be more
                challenging to install. But the type of metal or shingles used
                for your roof also factors into labor costs.

              <strong>Size and Complexity of Your Roof</strong>
              <p>
                Whether you choose metal or shingles for your new roof, the size
                and complexity will impact the total cost. The more complex your
                roof’s design, the more manpower and time it will take to
                complete your roofing installation, which means the labor costs
                will increase. In addition to roof features and steepness, other
                factors come into play. These include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Roof accessibility</li>
                  <li>Plumbing and gas vents</li>
                  <li>Roof height</li>
                  <li>Valleys on your roof</li>
                </ul>
                These factors can make the job take longer and impact the total
                replacement cost.

              <strong>Existing Roof Issues</strong>
              <p>
                Existing roofing issues will also affect your overall
                installation costs, regardless of the type of material you
                choose for your new roof. Technicians must perform the necessary
                repairs before laying a new roof. For example, if your roof
                sustained severe water damage, causing the underlying wood
                structures to rot, the deck would need to be replaced and the
                surrounding damage repaired before the replacement service could
                begin. Otherwise, the weight of the new materials wouldn’t be
                adequately supported, which could shorten their lifespan and
                increase the risk of other issues. Repair costs can vary
                significantly depending on the damage's type, extent, and
                location.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Warranty</strong>
              <p>
                The warranty coverage on your new roof depends on the type of
                materials used and is another vital factor in the overall cost
                of metal roofs vs. shingles. Most asphalt shingle manufacturers
                offer a full warranty for the first few years, typically on
                defective products, followed by a prorated or limited warranty
                in the following years. Some metal roofing manufacturers offer a
                lifetime warranty. The expected longevity of each type is also
                worth considering. Metal roofs containing weaker metals, such as
                corrugated metal or aluminum, may last for up to 30 years.
                However, more durable metal roofs, such as those made from
                copper or steel, can last up to 100 years. By contrast, a
                shingle roof might last between 10 and 30 years before requiring
                replacement.

              <strong>Maintenance</strong>
              <p>
                Roof maintenance includes regular inspections and prompt repairs
                when damage occurs, and it’s essential to keep up with it to
                help your roof last as long as possible. The cost to maintain
                your roof depends on the materials used and their age. Metal
                roofs are generally more expensive to repair than asphalt roofs
                because of higher material and labor costs. However, asphalt
                roofs are less durable than metal roofs; shingles may require
                frequent maintenance and repairs.
