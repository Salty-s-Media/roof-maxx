            When people think about protecting their roofs, they often think of
            annual maintenance, winter prep, and cleaning the gutters. However,
            some roof damage is unavoidable and may lead to a complete
            replacement, costing thousands of dollars. To avoid a hefty and
            unplanned roof replacement bill, consider getting a roof warranty.
            Read this roof warranty guide to learn all the essentials and
            determine if it is the right option for your home or business.

          <h2>What Is a Roof Warranty? An Overview</h2>
          <p>
            A roof warranty is a formal guarantee that the roof materials and/or
            roof installation will last a set number of years, barring any
            unforeseen catastrophes, such as a tornado or fallen tree. Roof
            damage caused by an act of nature or sudden accidental event often
            falls under a property owner&apos;s insurance policy, so if storms,
            floods, or fires are a worrying threat, consider investing in
            additional protection for your roof and property. The details of
            your roof warranty will vary depending on whether it&apos;s a
            manufacturer warranty or a contractor warranty. What&apos;s the
            difference?
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A manufacturer&apos;s warranty covers the materials.</li>
            <li>
              A contractor&apos;s warranty (also called a workmanship warranty)
              covers the roof&apos;s installation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When inquiring about a roof warranty, it&apos;s important to read
            the fine print, as every company may have slightly different
            policies. The Roof Maxx Warranty, for example, is valid for five
            years, beginning at the start date of the treatment, and remains
            valid even if the manufacturer&apos;s warranty becomes void.
            It&apos;s important to only work with roofing contractors who offer
            warranties because a warranty acts as a guarantee that the company
            you&apos;re working with is trustworthy and will stand behind their
            work. Should you buy a manufacturer or contractor warranty? And
            what&apos;s the difference between the two? Read on to learn more.

          <h2>What Is a Manufacturer&apos;s Roof Warranty?</h2>
          <p>
            Manufacturer roof warranties cover roofing materials, such as roof
            shingles. Manufacturer policies last between 10-30 years; however,
            some companies also offer 50-year or lifetime policies. Most
            companies offer a standard/limited version and a premium/extended
            version. Keep in mind that extended policies often have weaker
            long-term benefits past a specific date, and prices will be prorated
            (so they reflect future prices).
          </p>
          <h3>What Does a Manufacturer&apos;s Roof Warranty Cover?</h3>
          <p>
            What manufacturer roof warranties cover varies from company to
            company, but the cost of replacing defective shingles is nearly
            always covered. A few exceptions exist, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Poor roof maintenance—A manufacturer&apos;s roof policy will
              become void if you fail to care for your roof. For example, a
              warranty won&apos;t cover roof water damage if you neglect to
              clean your gutters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Poor installation—The manufacturer&apos;s warranty won&apos;t
              cover issues related to poor installation, which is why a
              contractor roof warranty is important.
            </li>
            <li>
              Extreme weather—Your policy often won&apos;t cover damage by
              extreme weather, such as hurricanes or tornadoes. However, if your
              shingles fall or crack outside of extreme weather events, the
              manufacturer will replace them at no extra cost.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>What Is a Contractor Roof Warranty?</h2>
          <p>
            A contractor roof warranty, also known as a workmanship warranty,
            covers the installation of your roof. A reputable contractor will
            offer contractor warranties to prove they are confident in their
            services.
          </p>
          <h3>What Does a Contractor&apos;s Roof Warranty Cover?</h3>
          <p>
            Contractor policies vary in length and terms. Before signing any
            paperwork, research the roofing company&apos;s reputation and
            policies. Meet with the contractor ahead of the installation to go
            over all the fine print. A contractor&apos;s warranty will often
            cover any damage or issues caused during the installation process.
            For example, a leak caused by improper shingle placement or damage
            to the exterior or interior of a home due to worker error. A few
            exceptions exist, such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Weather and acts of nature—A contractor&apos;s roof warranty will
              not cover damage caused by weather, flooding, water, fallen trees,
              or branches.
            </li>
            <li>
              Foot traffic—Your policy will often become void if you or another
              contracting company damages the roof by climbing or walking on it.
              Most policies do not cover damage done after the installation
              unless it happened as a result of an installation error.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>4 Steps to Protect Your Warranty</h2>
          <p>
            Roof warranties, especially contractor warranties, vary in quality
            and often have a lot of technical jargon. If you are struggling to
            understand the fine print, follow these four steps to protect your
            warranty.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Schedule Regular Inspections: By scheduling an annual inspection,
              you can help prevent issues before they occur. A professional can
              check for shingle or flashing damage, pest problems, leaks,
              standing water, ventilation issues, clogged gutters, and more. By
              properly maintaining your roof, you can avoid the need for costly
              repairs or early replacement.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay with Your Original Contractor: Keep the same contractor if
              possible. Doing so will allow you to build a long-term
              relationship, which means quicker repairs because they&apos;ll be
              familiar with their work and your roof. Keeping the same
              contractor can also help protect your warranty. Many contractors
              have strict policies that void the warranty if another contracting
              company alters the original company&apos;s work with additional
              repairs or additions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Register Your Warranty: Always submit your warranty registration
              directly to the manufacturer. If you&apos;re extending your policy
              or choosing a premium version, the process is a bit more
              complicated because your contractor has to submit the policy and
              be qualified to provide that policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Read all the Fine Print: Make sure that the contractor provides
              all the services they promised and that you understand each line
              of the policy before signing. Also, verify that the contractor is
              certified by the shingle manufacturer to offer you a policy.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Why Are Roofing Warranties so Important?</h2>
          <p>
            Roof replacement costs vary greatly depending on where you live,
            your roof materials, and the size and design of your roof. Replacing
            shingles can cost between $5,000 to $12,000. It&apos;s only logical
            to want to avoid further roof repair or replacement bills after
            installing your new roof. Seeing that roof warranties kick in
            whenever your roof contractor or manufacturer is at fault, you
            shouldn&apos;t have to foot the bill.
