          <p>
            Shingles are commonly used on both residential and commercial
            properties. Whether you&apos;re constructing a new building,
            considering a roofing upgrade, or wondering about the effect of a
            few missing shingles, it&apos;s helpful to know what to expect
            regarding the cost of shingles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cost can vary dramatically depending on your roof&apos;s shape
            and the type of shingles you select. However, $160 per 100 square
            feet is considered average for standard roofing in most locations.
            Each square buys most shingles.
          </p>
          <h2>Which Roofing Shingles Should I Buy?</h2>
          <p>
            Other than the cost of roofing shingles, the most common question
            is: what type of roofing shingle is best? Each shingle type provides
            a unique blend of style, protection, and cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way to determine which shingle is best for you is by
            clearly identifying your needs and your budget. There are three main
            types of shingles suitable for most roofing projects:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Three-Tab Shingles</li>
            <li>Dimensional Shingles</li>
            <li>Luxury Shingles</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>How Does Size Affect the Cost of Your Roof?</h2>
          <p>
            The larger the roof, the more shingles are needed to cover it. But
            the total cost of a shingle roof is also determined by the pitch and
            design of your particular roof.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of these complex factors, most roofing companies and roofers
            will visit your home to inspect the roof and provide an accurate
            estimate.
          </p>
          <h2>Types of Roofing Shingles</h2>
          <p>
            Explore the benefits and costs of different shingle types to find
            the best fit for your needs and budget. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Three-Tab Shingles - Average price: $100 per square (100 square
              feet)
            </li>
            <li>
              Dimensional Shingles - Average Price: $450 per square (100 square
              feet)
            </li>
            <li>
              Luxury Shingles - Average Price: $950 per square (100 square feet)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Considering Alternative Roofing Materials</h2>
          <p>
            Delve into metal roofing and ceramic tile roofing as alternatives to
            asphalt shingles, understanding their costs and benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, metal roofing can cost between $280 and $960 per square
            (100 square feet), while ceramic tile roofing averages between $300
            and $1,250 per square (100 square feet).
          </p>
          <h2>Other Costs to Consider</h2>
          <p>
            Replacing or installing a new roof involves more than just the cost
            of materials used. Labor, removal and disposal, gutter cleaning and
            replacement, and pest control are additional costs to keep in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter what type of roof you have, replacing it is expensive.
            Rather than replacing your entire roof, a preferable option may be
            to simply rejuvenate it with Roof Maxx.
