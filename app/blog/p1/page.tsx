          <h2>Factors to Consider When Choosing the Best Roof Shingles</h2>
          <p>
            Roof installations are one of the most common home improvement
            projects across the United States. Among the many roofing materials
            available, asphalt shingles are the most popular due to their
            durability, affordability, and ease of installation. In this guide,
            we&apos;ve compiled a list of the top-rated roof shingle
            manufacturers to help you choose the best roof shingles for your
            home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we dive into the most popular roof shingle brands, let&apos;s
            review the top factors to consider when choosing the best asphalt
            shingles for your home.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Cost: The cost of shingles will vary depending on the materials.
              Asphalt shingles are popular because of their affordability
              compared to more expensive roofing materials like metal, clay, and
              slate. If you choose slate for your roof, you can expect to pay at
              least five times as much as asphalt per square foot. It&apos;s
              best to have a set budget before looking around to know which
              roofing materials are on the table for you, then select a roofing
              material that offers the best value for your budget.
            </li>
            <li>
              Durability: To get the best value for your money, choose roofing
              shingles that are highly rated in terms of durability. Certain
              roofing options will work better in specific climates. For
              instance, clay and ceramic tiles perform better than asphalt in
              hot climates. Consult a roofer to get the best fit for your home.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aesthetics: Modern roofing materials come in various colors,
              textures, and finishes. Select the roofing shingle that matches
              your preferences and your home&apos;s architectural style.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintenance Requirements: When choosing the best roof shingles for
              your home, consider the upkeep and maintenance effort required for
              each material before making a decision.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How Much Does It Cost to Install Roofing Shingles and Tiles?</h2>
          <p>
            A new asphalt shingle installation can cost anywhere from $8,000 to
            $12,000. The exact cost depends on the material type chosen, labor
            costs, and the size and design of your roof.
          </p>

          <h2>What Is the Best Color for Roofing Shingles and Tiles?</h2>
          <p>
            Shingle color can affect the appearance of your property, including
            its size. Darker shades can make objects appear smaller and more
            compact, while lighter colors can make objects look larger and
            closer.
          </p>

          <h2>How Are Asphalt Shingles Tested?</h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to asphalt shingles, there&apos;s a specific level of
            quality called an AC438 level; these shingles are considered the
            best of the best. To receive this title, shingles must withstand the
            tests of temperature, wind, and weather.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              During the temperature test, the shingle is faced with 12-24 hours
              of extreme heat or cold, dunked in water, and then inspected
              closely. If there is no wear and tear on the shingle, it moves on
              to the next test: weather.
            </li>
            <li>
              When testing weather durability, the shingle must alternate
              between hours in the sun and the water. After this test, the
              asphalt and foundations of the shingle are checked before it moves
              on to the final test: wind resistance.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the wind test, the shingle is placed on a slope, simulating
              a roof; and is then exposed to periods of increasingly harsh
              conditions of rain and wind.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What Is the Average Lifespan of Shingles?</h2>
          <p>
            The best roof shingles are marketed to last between 25 to 50 years,
            but some roofs don&apos;t last more than 7 to 10 years. A variety of
            factors affect the lifespan of your roof, including climate, roof
            design, proper installation, correct maintenance, and using the
            right materials.
          </p>

          <h2>How to Get the Best Asphalt Shingles for Your Home</h2>
          <p>
            The best asphalt shingles for your home depend on your priorities,
            budget, and location. Consider factors like durability, energy
            efficiency, appearance, and warranty when choosing shingles.
          </p>
