          Do You Need Rain Gutters On Your House?

            Of all the important features that keep your home safe and sound,
            the rain gutters might not seem that important. In fact, they serve
            a number of vital functions that keep your home strong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Are there instances, though, when you might get away with not having
            gutters? You might ask, do I need gutters on my house? There can be
            circumstances in which a home might not need gutters. To understand
            why, it&apos;s important to know why gutters are typically so
            critical.
          </p>
          <h2>What Do Rain Gutters Do?</h2>
          <p>
            Rain gutt&apos;rs seem pretty straightforward. They line the edges
            of a structure&apos;s roof to catch the rain and melting snow
            running down the roof to direct it to downspouts. The downspouts
            then direct the water away from the building.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without gutters, the rain would run straight off the roof along the
            entire edges. But is this a bad thing? Do you need gutters on your
            house, or can you just let the water run off the roof?
          </p>
          <p>
            In most cases, you need rain gutters. However, if you&apos;ve built
            your roof very steep with a large overhang that already directs the
            water far from your home, then you could get away without gutters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, if the landscaping around your home slopes away from the
            structure, then gutters are less necessary. The water that falls to
            the ground around the house would then flow downhill away from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            In climates that receive very little rain, gutters come in less
            handy. However, even in a dry climate, you still get rain, and
            it&apos;s often heavy when it does fall. If you live in a dry
            climate and are thinking about going without gutters, the
            landscaping around your home would still need to slope away from
            your house.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Do You Need Rain Gutters?</h2>
          <p>
            As you can see, there are only a few very specific circumstances
            that would allow you to safely get away without gutters on your
            house. The question then is, what makes gutters so important?
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer to that question becomes quite clear when you see what
            can happen to a home that lacks rain gutters. Since rain gutters
            direct water away from the structure, not having them would allow
            rainwater to accumulate along the house. This can lead to serious
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Water accumulating along your home can seep into the ground and
            damage the foundation. Cracks can form and cause basement leaks.
            This compromises the entire integrity of your home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allowing the water to flow off your roof will also lead to the
            formation of channels in the surrounding soil. This can eat away at
            your yard and cause additional issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            That&apos;s why you can only get away with not having gutters when
            the roof has a large overhang and the landscaping slopes away from
            the home. These elements would help carry the rainwater and snowmelt
            away from the house and keep it from accumulating near the
            foundation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rain gutters are recommended for nearly all homes. It&apos;s a
            simple way to protect your property from significant damage.
            It&apos;s also important to maintain your gutters so they continue
            to function properly. This means clearing debris and potential
            blockages from your gutters and making sure they stay completely
            secured to the roof.

            Find Out How to Keep Your Roof Strong While Saving Money: Keeping
            your gutters in good shape is only part of the equation. You also
            need to make sure your shingles stay strong and function as they
            should. As shingles age, they lose their ability to expand and
            contract with changes in the weather. They can then crack and allow
            water to penetrate your roof and cause damage beneath.
