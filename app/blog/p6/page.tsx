          <h2>What Are the Least Expensive Roofing Options?</h2>
          <p>
            Asphalt shingles are by far the most popular roofing materials
            because they have relatively low upfront costs. Still, there are
            other things to consider, such as the lifetime cost of materials and
            how often you have to replace them. Look at our rundown of different
            roofing materials and their pros and cons, then consider an
            alternative that can extend the life of asphalt shingles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: This rundown is for sloped roofs. For more information on flat
            roofing materials, see our blog on different types of roofs.
          </p>
          <h3>Asphalt Roofs</h3>
          <p>
            Asphalt shingles are the most popular due to their low upfront cost.
            To ensure they last as long as possible, asphalt shingles require a
            well-ventilated roof, so give some thought to how you will ventilate
            the roof and what kind of vent caps you want if you need ventilation
            holes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don&apos;t forget to take into account the hail rating of any
            shingles you look at. Shingles vary widely in quality, and the hail
            rating is an excellent way to estimate durability and impact
            resistance. If you can&apos;t find the hail rating, consider a
            different brand of shingles.
          </p>
          <h4>3 KINDS OF ASPHALT SHINGLES</h4>
          <p>
            3-tab shingles lay flat on the roof and have three tabs per strip.
            They are the cheapest asphalt shingles and can last 15–25 years if
            installed properly on a well-ventilated roof.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dimensional shingles can simulate the look of wood shingles or give
            a pleasing random pattern. They cost about 15% more than 3-tab
            shingles. On a properly ventilated roof, they can last up to 30
            years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luxury shingles are larger than dimensional shingles and cost about
            twice as much. They are designed to resemble slate shingles.
          </p>
          <h4>PROS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Lowest upfront costs</li>
            <li>Durable</li>
            <li>Can be recycled/made of recycled materials</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>CONS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Require more maintenance than other materials</li>
            <li>Need to be replaced more often than other materials</li>
            <li>
              Susceptible to moss, curling and cracking, and water getting under
              them and freezing
            </li>
            <li>
              Recyclers can be difficult to find, so they usually end up in the
              landfill
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Wood Shingles and Shakes</h3>
          <p>
            Wood shingles and shakes last longer than asphalt shingles (30–50
            years), provide better insulation, and have a classic look.
          </p>
          <h4>PROS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Fire-resistant and can be treated with fire retardant</li>
            <li>100% natural, a sustainable resource</li>
            <li>Energy-efficient, a natural insulator</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>CONS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Not as durable as asphalt shingles</li>
            <li>Liable to cracking, so pay attention to the hail rating</li>
            <li>Not fireproof</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Metal Roofs</h3>
          <p>
            Metal roofing is a classic American roofing material and looks
            classy. The price of metal roofs varies widely. On the low end,
            metal roofs are a bit more expensive than asphalt and last a lot
            longer. On the high end, they can cost several times as much.
            Aluminum and galvanized metal are among the least expensive metal
            roofing options. Zinc and copper are among the most expensive.
          </p>
          <h4>PROS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Highly sustainable because they are easy to recycle</li>
            <li>Long-lasting (50 years or more)</li>
            <li>Low-maintenance if installed properly</li>
            <li>
              Reflects heat rather than absorbing it, keeping the house cooler
              than asphalt shingles
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>CONS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Can have very high upfront costs</li>
            <li>Can be noisy during heavy rain or hailstorms</li>
            <li>Requires expert installation, not a DIY project</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Slate</h3>
          <p>
            Slate is a natural material, among the oldest roofing materials, and
            the most durable. However, a slate roof can last 75–150 years,
            making it less expensive in the long run.
          </p>
          <h4>PROS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Durable and sustainable, a naturally occurring material</li>
            <li>Dense, with excellent energy efficiency</li>
            <li>Fireproof</li>

          </ul>
          <h4>CONS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              High upfront costs mean recouping the investment can take many
              years
            </li>
            <li>
              Can crack under a person&apos;s weight, so take care if you need
              to go on the roof
            </li>
            <li>They may outlast the life of the house</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Solar Glass</h3>
          <p>
            Solar glass combines the electricity-generating capabilities of
            solar panels with high energy efficiency, an excellent hail rating,
            and a lifetime warranty.
          </p>
          <h4>PROS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Can eventually pay for themselves through electricity generation
            </li>

          <h3>Roof Maxx - The Actual Cheapest Roofing Replacement Option</h3>
          <p>
            Which roofing is least expensive depends on how much time you have
            and your budget. A more expensive roof will be an excellent
            long-term investment if you can afford the upfront costs. But what
            if you can&apos;t afford costly materials? Are you stuck with
            tearing your asphalt shingles off the roof and replacing them with
